# OPEN & REPRODUCIBLE MICROBIOME DATA ANALYSIS SPRING SCHOOL 2018  

![SPRING SCHOOL 2018](https://github.com/mibwurrepo/Microbial-bioinformatics-introductory-course-Material-2018/blob/master/images/logos.png)

Three day spring school on basics of high throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing data analysis. This spring school is organised in collaboration with [VLAG graduate school](https://www.vlaggraduateschool.nl/en.htm), [Laboratory of Microbiology](https://www.wur.nl/en/Expertise-Services/Chair-groups/Agrotechnology-and-Food-Sciences/Laboratory-of-Microbiology.htm), [Laboratory of Systems and Synthetic Biology](http://systemsbiology.nl), Wageningen University & Research, the Netherlands and [Department of Mathematics and Statistics University of Turku](https://www.utu.fi/en/units/sci/units/math/Pages/home.aspx), Finland. This year it will be held at [Wageningen University & Research](https://www.wur.nl/en.htm). We will cover topics related to basics of sequencing and microbial community analysis. We will use [NG-Tax]( https://f1000research.com/articles/5-1791/v1) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/) based tools like [Phyloseq](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0061217), [microbiome](http://microbiome.github.io/microbiome/) and [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) for downstream data analysis and visualization.
